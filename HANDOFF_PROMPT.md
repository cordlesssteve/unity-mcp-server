## ðŸš€ **Next Session Priorities**

### **Immediate Actions Required**
1. **Debug Unity Editor Connection Stability**
   - Unity Editor was starting but exiting during testing
   - Named pipe connection timing may need adjustment
   - Investigate Unity Editor lifecycle management

2. **Test Complete Unity IPC Workflow**
   - Establish reliable Unity Editor startup
   - Verify named pipe connection establishment
   - Test full command/response cycle (ping, get_state, play mode control)

3. **Validate Unity Events Broadcasting**
   - Test Unity Editor event emission (play mode changes, scene loading)
   - Verify real-time state synchronization
   - Ensure Unity Console logging shows MCP Bridge messages

### **Development Roadmap**
See `ACTIVE_PLAN.md` for complete Phase 2 development plan focusing on:
- Unity Editor connection stabilization
- Advanced Unity operations (build automation, asset management)
- Natural language Unity interface
- Unity workflow automation

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Context for Next Session**

### **Key Implementation Patterns**
```typescript
// Unity IPC Connection Pattern
const unityIPC = new UnityIPC(projectPath, logger);
const connected = await unityIPC.connect();
// Pipe name generated as: unity-mcp-${projectHash}

// Unity State Monitoring
const state = await unityIPC.getUnityState();
// Returns: unityVersion, projectName, isPlaying, activeScene, etc.

// Unity Command Execution
await unityIPC.setPlayMode(true); // Start play mode
await unityIPC.loadScene(scenePath); // Load scene
await unityIPC.refreshAssets(); // Refresh assets
```

### **Unity Plugin Architecture**
```csharp
// Auto-initialization in Unity Editor
[InitializeOnLoad]
public static class MCPServerBridge
{
    // Named pipe server: unity-mcp-{projectHash}
    // Commands: get_state, enter_play_mode, exit_play_mode, ping, refresh_assets
    // Events: state_update, play_mode_changed, scene_opened, hierarchy_changed
}
```

### **Current Blockers**
- Unity Editor process stability during startup
- Named pipe connection timing and reliability
- Unity Editor plugin initialization timing
