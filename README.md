**The first conversational AI interface for Unity Editor** - Transform Unity development through natural language interaction and intelligent automation.

## 🚀 **What is Unity MCP Server?**

Unity MCP Server revolutionizes Unity development by providing an intelligent AI assistant that understands your goals, learns your patterns, and accelerates your workflow through natural language commands.

### **Instead of this:**
```bash
# Complex command-line operations
Unity.exe -batchmode -projectPath "MyProject" -executeMethod BuildScript.Build -quit
```

### **Do this:**
```
You: "Build my project for Windows with debug symbols"
Unity MCP: "Building Windows development build with debug symbols...
           Build completed successfully in 2.3 minutes.
           Output: builds/windows-dev/MyGame.exe (45.2 MB)"
```
