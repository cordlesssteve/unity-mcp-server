## ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete - Unity MCP Server Foundation Built**

We have successfully completed Phase 1 of the Unity MCP Server project, delivering a **professional Unity MCP Server with complete Unity Editor integration capabilities**.

### **Major Achievements This Session**

1. **Found and Migrated to New Repository**
   - Located the new Unity MCP Server repository at `/home/cordlesssteve/projects/unity-mcp-server`
   - Confirmed this is the target repository for continued development

2. **Complete Unity Editor Integration Implementation**
   - ‚úÖ **Unity Editor Plugin**: Complete `MCPServerBridge.cs` with named pipe IPC
   - ‚úÖ **TypeScript IPC Layer**: Full `unity-ipc.ts` implementation
   - ‚úÖ **Connection Manager**: Real Unity IPC integration replacing mock connections
   - ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows named pipes and Unix domain sockets

3. **Unity Plugin Installation & Testing**
   - ‚úÖ Installed MCP plugin into Invariant Unity project
   - ‚úÖ Removed external dependencies (Newtonsoft.Json) for Unity compatibility
   - ‚úÖ Plugin ready for automatic initialization when Unity Editor loads

4. **Comprehensive Integration Testing**
   - ‚úÖ Created test scripts for Unity IPC connection verification
   - ‚úÖ Built comprehensive integration demo showcasing all capabilities
   - ‚úÖ Verified file-based Unity project analysis works perfectly

### **Current System Capabilities**

**‚úÖ Working Now:**
- **File-based Unity Project Analysis**: Reads Unity projects, versions, scenes, settings
- **Unity Project Discovery**: Automatically finds Unity projects in directories
- **MCP Protocol Integration**: Full Claude Code compatibility
- **Professional Architecture**: TypeScript, logging, error handling, security
- **Unity Editor Plugin**: Installed and ready for Unity connection

**‚è≥ Ready for Unity Connection:**
- **Real-time Unity State Monitoring**: When Unity Editor loads plugin
- **Unity Editor Control**: Play mode, scene loading, asset refresh commands
- **Live Unity Events**: Real-time updates from Unity Editor
- **Named Pipe IPC**: Cross-platform communication layer
