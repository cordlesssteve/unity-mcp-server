## üîß **Technical Implementation Strategy**

### **Unity Editor Connection**
```typescript
// Priority: Stabilize this connection pattern
const unityIPC = new UnityIPC(projectPath, logger);
const connected = await unityIPC.connect();
if (connected) {
    // Implement reliable command execution
    const state = await unityIPC.getUnityState();
    // Handle real-time Unity events
}
```

### **Unity Operations Framework**
```typescript
// Build comprehensive Unity automation
interface UnityOperation {
    command: string;
    parameters: Record<string, any>;
    validation: (params) => boolean;
    execute: (unity: UnityIPC) => Promise<UnityResult>;
}
```

### **Natural Language Processing**
```typescript
// Enable conversational Unity development
interface UnityCommand {
    intent: string;
    entities: UnityEntity[];
    operations: UnityOperation[];
    response: string;
}
```

## üìù **Development Notes**

### **Key Technical Decisions**
- **Named Pipes for IPC**: Proven cross-platform, low-latency communication
- **TypeScript Foundation**: Type safety and modern development practices
- **Unity Editor Plugin**: Deep Unity integration without external dependencies
- **MCP Protocol**: Claude Code native integration

### **Architecture Principles**
- **Fail-Safe Graceful Degradation**: Always provide file-based fallback
- **Real-time Responsiveness**: Sub-second Unity command execution
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Windows, macOS, Linux support
- **Security First**: Input validation, path traversal protection

### **Current Blockers**
- Unity Editor connection stability needs investigation
- Named pipe connection timing may need adjustment
- Unity Editor lifecycle management requires refinement
